Welcome! This is the GitHub Home for DOI.

We're not sure yet what this will evolve into, but if you work at DOI and love open source and GitHub, send a note to @gillick and he'll add you to this group.

At the very least we'd like to use this as a resource to link people to other DOI GitHub homes and people. The ones we know about so far are:

+ [USGS](https://github.com/usgs)
+ [NPS](https://github.com/nationalparkservice)
+ [BIA](https://github.com/usindianaffairs)
+ [USBR](https://github.com/usbr)
+ [USFWS](https://github.com/USFWS)
+ Who else is out there?
